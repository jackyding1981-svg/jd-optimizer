|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| Completeness | Missing 5+ key dimensions | All dimensions clearly addressed |
| Specificity | Vague, generic descriptions | Concrete, measurable requirements |
| Competency Focus | Pure task list, no competencies | Competency-based with clear outcomes |
| Market Alignment | Outdated terms, below-market | Current terminology, competitive |
| Inclusivity | Biased language, unnecessary barriers | Inclusive, focuses on essential requirements |
| Readability | Wall of text, poor structure | Well-organized, scannable sections |
| Value Proposition | No EVP, one-sided demands | Clear EVP, mutual value exchange |
| Future Orientation | Static, backward-looking | Forward-looking, growth-oriented |

## 3. Common Issues in Traditional JDs

Identify and flag these typical problems:

- **Task-list syndrome**: Lists tasks without explaining purpose or impact
- **Skill inflation**: Requires unnecessary qualifications (e.g., Master's for entry-level)
- **Kitchen-sink requirements**: Too many "must-have" skills that discourage qualified candidates
- **Missing EVP**: No employer value proposition or career growth information
- **Biased language**: Gendered or age-biased wording
- **Outdated terminology**: Uses obsolete job titles or skill names
- **No competency model**: Lacks behavioral competencies, only lists technical skills
- **Vague responsibilities**: Uses ambiguous phrases like "other duties as assigned"
