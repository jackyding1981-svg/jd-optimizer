## 2. Writing Principles

Follow these principles when generating the optimized JD:

| Principle | Guideline |
|-----------|-----------|
| Outcome-oriented | Describe what success looks like, not just tasks |
| Competency-based | Emphasize capabilities and behaviors, not just credentials |
| Inclusive language | Avoid gendered, age-biased, or unnecessarily restrictive language |
| Value exchange | Balance what is required with what is offered |
| Future-looking | Include emerging skills and growth trajectory |
| Specific and measurable | Use concrete metrics and examples where possible |
| Scannable format | Use headers, bullets, and white space for readability |

## 3. Section Guidelines

**Job Title**: Use standardized, searchable titles. Avoid internal jargon. Include level indicator (Junior/Senior/Lead/Principal).

**Responsibilities**: Start each with an action verb. Focus on outcomes and impact, not process. Group by theme (e.g., "Strategy", "Execution", "Leadership").

**Requirements**: Separate must-have from nice-to-have. Be specific about experience type, not just years. Include both hard and soft skills.

**Competencies**: Align with modern competency frameworks. Include forward-looking competencies (e.g., AI literacy, adaptive learning).

**Value Proposition**: Make it compelling and specific. Include tangible benefits, culture, growth opportunities.

## 4. Language and Tone

- Use second person ("You will...") for engagement
- Prefer active voice over passive
- Keep sentences concise (under 25 words)
- Avoid jargon unless industry-standard
- Use gender-neutral language throughout
- Match tone to company culture (professional yet approachable)
- Output language should match the original JD's language (Chinese JD → Chinese output, English JD → English output)
